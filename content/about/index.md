I got introduced to Computer Science at school.

After wrapping up a rewarding two-and-a-half-year stint at [IBM](#AboutMe) as a Software Engineer, I embarked on a journey to graduate with a Master's degree from [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/)

I am an [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/e8ba2f29-1d88-44b7-9e46-b3df461a726b) and [IBM Certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/23e8cdf6-ed3a-4a61-9a88-73fbace2374f). My journey with AWS started at IBM but soared when I worked with the [AWS Cloud Innovation Center at ASU](https://smartchallenges.asu.edu/) to solve community challenges while pursuing my graduate studies. 

I have also interned at [FOX Tech](https://tech.fox.com/) for the significant part of the 2023 - 2024 academic year, with back-to-back internships in the Data Science team and the Broadcast Engineering team.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
