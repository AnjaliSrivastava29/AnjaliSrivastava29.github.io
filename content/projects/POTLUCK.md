In partnership with Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) and Age Friendly Arizona, The POTLUCK  (People-Oriented Transportation Linkages for Underserved Communities) prototype system is designed so that it would allow doctor’s offices and transportation providers to work together under the goal of ensuring that patients arrive at scheduled appointments, on time and safely. 

The solution would provide a clean, easy-to-use interface for both doctor’s offices and transportation providers to enter such information.
